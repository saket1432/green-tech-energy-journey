# 🌱 Clean & Green Energy Portfolio

A modern, interactive web portfolio showcasing renewable energy sources and sustainable solutions. This project explores three key renewable energy technologies through detailed explanations, block diagrams, and real-world applications.

## 📋 Project Overview

This portfolio website presents comprehensive information about renewable energy sources, designed as an educational resource for understanding sustainable energy solutions. The project covers three main renewable energy technologies:

### 🔋 Featured Energy Sources

1. **🌊 Tidal Energy**
   - Harnesses kinetic energy from ocean tides
   - Predictable and constant energy source
   - Real-world example: La Rance Tidal Power Station, France

2. **🌿 Biomass Energy**
   - Converts organic materials into energy
   - Carbon-neutral when sustainably sourced
   - Applications: Power plants, biogas, biofuels

3. **🔥 Geothermal & OTEC Energy**
   - Geothermal: Earth's internal heat
   - OTEC: Ocean temperature differences
   - Example: Iceland's geothermal plants
